### 3. **Health Calculation Engine Enhancements**
- **Temporal Decay Algorithm**: Fixed the decay calculation to properly differentiate between recent and old events
- **Weight-Based Scaling**: Implemented proper scaling that ensures temporal decay affects final health scores
- **Minimum Decay Factor**: Added minimum decay factor (0.1) to prevent complete loss of impact from old events

### 4. **AI Processor Improvements**
- **Enhanced Fallback Logic**: Improved keyword-based fallback processing for community tips
- **Condition/Exclusion Extraction**: Added intelligent extraction of conditions and exclusions from tip text
- **Effectiveness Adjustment**: Implemented logic to reduce effectiveness based on conditions and exclusions
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved error handling and logging for AI processing failures

### 5. **Code Organization**
- **Import Cleanup**: Removed unused imports across all modules
- **Consistent Formatting**: Applied consistent code formatting and style
- **Proper Indentation**: Fixed all indentation issues in multi-line statements
